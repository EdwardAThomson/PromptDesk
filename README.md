# PromptDesk

A minimalist **AI-powered desktop** that runs entirely in your browser.

Create notes, folders, and chat windows connected to **OpenAI**, **Claude**, or **Gemini** — all saved locally, with no backend (currently) required.

## 🧩 Architecture Overview

PromptDesk uses a **single-page HTML + JS + CSS** architecture:

- `index.html` — main entry point, loads the desktop and modal UI.  
- `app.js` — handles all logic (file system, chat UI, API calls, persistence).  
- `styles.css` — minimal styling for draggable windows and modals.  

All files and settings are stored in `localStorage` under the `promptdesk_data` key.
