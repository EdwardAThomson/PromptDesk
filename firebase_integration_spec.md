## Specification: Firebase Integration for Multi-User Support

### Objective
Enhance the current JavaScript-based LLM Desktop App with Firebase integration to support multiple independent users.

### Core Features to Build

#### 1. Firebase Project Setup
- Create a new Firebase project.
- Set up Firebase Authentication with email/password or Google OAuth.
- Set up Firestore database with a simple hierarchical structure.

#### 2. User Authentication
- Integrate Firebase Authentication in the frontend (vanilla JavaScript).
- Provide simple login/logout UI components.
- Manage user sessions to show/hide the user's personalized desktop items.

#### 3. Firestore Data Integration
- Modify the app to save and retrieve desktop items from Firestore.
- Structure Firestore database as:
```
Users (collection)
  └── {userId} (document)
      └── items (subcollection)
          └── {itemId} (document)
              ├── type: "file" or "folder"
              ├── name
              ├── content (if file)
              └── parentFolderId (null if root)
```
- Ensure users can only read/write their own data.

#### 4. Backend for Secure LLM API Calls
- Set up a simple Node.js backend (or Firebase Cloud Functions).
- Backend retrieves the user's data and securely handles LLM API requests.
- Keep API keys secure and hidden from the frontend.

#### 5. User Interface Adjustments
- Update existing vanilla JavaScript UI to dynamically reflect user-specific data.
- Clearly indicate login status and provide easy login/logout options.

### Out-of-Scope (for now)
- Collaborative group editing.
- Complex role management.

This concise specification outlines only what's practically needed for Firebase integration and initial multi-user support, suitable for immediate implementation.
